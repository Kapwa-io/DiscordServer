# DiscordServer
Find more info about Kapwa's community here.

A community where people can share insights about their small businesses, network, collaborate with other startups, or just hang out. Bonus if you also love developing projects that can integrate solutions for these communities using blockchain for decentralization and privacy. You can also team up with people from the community when joining hackathons or starting a business or initiative.

We believe that in order to create systemic change, communities should be at the center of developing solutions. And it is only by working together that we can achieve anything. Let us know of anything we can do to improve the community.

It's mainly a development and support server. But we encourage the community to engage here so we can develop community ties and work side-by-side to help decide which direction the company should go.
